# C Portfolio Website

This is a revamp of my website made using C for the backend and HTML, CSS, & Javascript for the frontend. 


## Goals:
1. Create a webserver from scratch using C.
2. Make a website with a overall size of less than 100kb;
3. Make a "pleasant looking" website without the use of any framework.
